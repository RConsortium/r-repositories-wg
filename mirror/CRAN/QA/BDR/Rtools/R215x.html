This page is for R 2.14.2 and later <b>only</b>:

<h2>Multilib toolchain</h2>

The current toolchain is based on Mingw-w64's build of gcc pre-4.6.3
and version 2.0.1 of their runtime (for both 32- and 64-bit builds).
See the 'R Installation and Administration Manual' for how to make use of it.

<p>
This is part of <tt>Rtools215.exe</tt> and <tt>Rtools216.exe</tt>
available from
<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/">here<a>
and separately as <a href="multilib/multi.zip"><tt>multi.zip</tt><a> (53MB)

<p>
Note that this is a <em>multilib</em> toolchain.  All the tools are 32-bit Windows
executables, so this toolchain can be run on 32- or 64-bit Windows.
Generating 64-bit code is selected by a flag (for the compilers,
<tt>-m64</tt>).

<p>
The toolchain contains separate 32- and 64-bit versions of <tt>gdb</tt>:
either its <tt>bin32</tt> or <tt>bin64</tt> directory can put in your path
or <tt>/path/to/binxx/gdb.exe</tt> used directly.

<p>
All the sources are in the <tt><a href="multilib">multilib</a></tt> directory.


<h3>OpenMP and pthreads</h3>

Three alternative implementations of <tt>pthreads</tt> are available,
<tt><a href="multilib/pthreads-w32.zip">pthreads-w32</a></tt>,
<tt><a href="multilib/winpthreads.zip">winpthreads</a></tt>
and
<tt><a href="multilib/winpthreads-static.zip">winpthreads-static</a></tt>:
all unpack to the same location as the candidate toolchain.
These are needed to support OpenMP and can also be used on their own.
<p>
<tt>pthreads-w32</tt> is a more mature implementation, but based only on 
DLLs which you would need to ship with a package that makes use of it.
Further, as those DLLs are licensed under LGPL, you need to meet their
licence requirements (the sources are
<a href="sources/pthreads-win32.tar.gz">here</a>).
<p>
<tt>winpthreads</tt> is from the `experimental' branch of the
MinGW-w64 project.  The two versions differ in using DLLs and static
linking: there are some known problems (at least with the DLL version)
for 64-bit builds with packages using C++.
<p>
The current toolchain packaging includes static <tt>winpthreads</tt>,
which has proved to be the most satisfactory..

<h3>Tcl/Tk</h3>

32-bit build of Tcl/Tk:
<a href="R_Tcl_8-5-8.zip"><tt>R_Tcl_8-5-8.zip</tt></a>.
<br>
64-bit build of Tcl/Tk:
<a href="R64a_Tcl_8-5-8.zip"><tt>R64a_Tcl_8-5-8.zip</tt></a>.

<p>
The procedures and scripts used to compile the <tt>Tcl</tt> directory
and in particular to produce the help file are at
<a href="https://svn.r-project.org/R-packages/trunk/R-Tcl-win/"><tt>https://svn.r-project.org/R-packages/trunk/R-Tcl-win/</tt></a>.
The sources used were
<a href="sources/tcl8.5.8-src.tar.gz"><tt>tcl8.5.8-src.tar.gz</tt></a>,
<a href="sources/tk8.5.8-src.tar.gz"><tt>tk8.5.8-src.tar.gz</tt></a>, 
<a href="sources/BWidget-1.8.0.tar.bz2"><tt>BWidget-1.8.0.tar.bz2</tt></a> and
<a href="sources/Tktable2.9.tar.gz"><tt>Tktable2.9.tar.gz</tt></a>.

<h2>External software</h2>

External software to build packages should ideally be built under
this toolchain: software with a C++ interface definitely will need to be.

<p>
The software we provide is under the
<tt><a href="goodies/multilib">goodies/multilib</a></tt>
directory.

<p>
This includes a comprehensive `local' tree as 
<a href="goodies/multilib/local215.zip"><tt>local215.zip</tt></a>
which can be unpacked and pointed to by the <tt>LOCAL_SOFT</tt> macro
in file <tt>src/gnuwin32/MkRules.dist</tt> when building from sources,
or in the <tt>etc/{i386,x64}/Makeconf</tt> files in a binary distribution.
This contains headers and static libraries for
<tt>expat</tt> (2.0.1),
<tt>fftw3</tt> (3.3.3),
<tt>gdal</tt> (1.9.2, includes ODBC drivers),
<tt>geos</tt> (3.3.6),
<tt>gmp</tt> (5.0.5),
<tt>gsl</tt> (1.15),
<tt>jpeg</tt> (8d),
<tt>libiconv</tt> (1.14)
<tt>libmpc</tt> (0.9: the <tt>mpc</tt> package does not work with 1.x),
<tt>libpng</tt> (1.5.13)
<tt>libsndfile</tt> (1.0.25),
<tt>libxml2</tt> (2.7.8),
<tt>libz</tt> (1.2.7),
<tt>mpfr</tt> (3.1.1),
<tt>netcdf</tt> (4.0.1, for use with <tt>RNetCDF</tt> and <tt>ncdf</tt>, not <tt>ncdf4</tt>),
<tt>proj</tt> (4.7.0),
<tt>sprng</tt> (2.0b),
<tt>tiff</tt> (4.0.3)
and
<tt>udunits2</tt> (2.1.24)

<p>
There are also binary versions of <tt>Clp</tt>, <tt>glpk</tt>,
<tt>nlopt</tt>, <tt>QuantLib</tt> and <tt>SYMPHONY</tt> for use with
packages <tt>clpAPI</tt>, <tt>glpkAPI</tt>, <tt>nloptr</tt>,
<tt>RQuantLib</tt> and <tt>Rsymphony</tt>.  Some are packaged separately 
for 32- and 64-bit R, and and some are multilib.

<p>
Sources are under <tt><a href="goodies/sources">goodies/sources</a></tt> directory.
