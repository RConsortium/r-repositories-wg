<h2>Universal nightly builds for Mac OS X (10.5 Leopard and higher)</h2>
<h3>R framework</h3>

<!--include R-builds.html-->

<!--
 <i>Important note:</i> Leopard builds above are strictly <i>experimental</i> and not supported by CRAN (i.e., there are no binary packages). Although CRAN packages may accidentally be compatible, they exist only for 32-bit, so for 64-bit R you <i>must</i> use <tt>install.packages(...,type='source')</tt> and have all necessary development tools. -->
<p>
<u>Requirements</u>: Mac OS X 10.5 or higher. For additional tools necessary for compiling packages, see below - Xcode 3.1 or higher is required on OS X 10.5 (Leopard) and Xcode 3.2 or higher on OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard).

<p>
The installer image (<tt>*.pkg</tt>) is packaged exactly the same way as the CRAN release of R (including the GUI) and it will update your R version (unless you use <tt>pkgutil</tt> - see instructions during installation). Alternatively you can use the tar-ball (<tt>*.tar.gz</tt>) which must be unpacked in the root (e.g. <tt>tar fvxz R*.tar.gz -C /</tt>), but doesn't contain the GUI (see below for a separate download).
<p>

<!--
[previous version: <b>R 2.9.0</b> (2009/04/17): <a href=R-2.9.0.pkg>R-2.9.0.pkg</a> (ca. 61MB, includes Fortran for Xcode 3.1.2 - do NOT install if you have Xcode 3.2!)<p>
[previous R version: <a href=R-2.8-branch-leopard.pkg>R-2.8-branch-leopard.pkg</a> (ca. 58MB, includes Fortran for Xcode 3.1.2)].
-->
<!--
Download: <b>R 2.9.0 beta</b> (2009/04/08): <a href=R-2.9-beta-48309.pkg>R-2.9-beta-48309.pkg</a>
(ca. 61MB, includes Fortran for Xcode 3.1.2)<p>
older version: <a href=R-2.8-branch-leopard.pkg>R-2.8-branch-leopard.pkg</a> (ca. 58MB, includes Fortran for Xcode 3.1.2).
-->

<p>
<!--
Leopard builds can be installed as follows - paste in <i>Terminal</i> (for R 2.8.x):<br>
<div id=RC class=RC><tt>curl -s http://r.research.att.com/R-2.8-branch-leopard-universal.tar.gz | sudo tar fvxz - -C /</tt></div>
Then pick the corresponding GUI below (32-bit or 64-bit or both). -->
 On the command line the R is by default 32-bit, for 64-bit use <tt>R --arch x86_64</tt> (Intel Macs) or <tt>R --arch ppc64</tt> (PowerPC G5). The above Leopard installer package installs the 32-bit GUI as <tt>R.app</tt> and the 64-bit GUI as <tt>R64.app</tt>.
<!-- <p>
For experimental/beta binary builds of packages use <tt>http://r.research.att.com/</tt> repository.
-->
<!--
<p>
The build results for CRAN can be found at the <a href=http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/checkSummary.html>CRAN check summary page</a>. For Bioconductor packages see <a href=/results/>http://r.research.att.com/results/</a>. Package maintainers, please check this page after you release a new package or version.

<a name=leopard>
<h3>Leopard build</h3>
Leopard builds are for Mac OS X 10.5 (<b>Leopard</b>) and Mac OS X 10.6 (<b>Snow Leopard</b>) and are available in 32-bit (PowerPC+Intel) and 64-bit (Intel only). The nightly builds are above and releases are now on CRAN. Note that the default package type for that build is <tt>"mac.binary.leopard"</tt>. Please make sure you delete all old packages and re-install them after upgrading from the older Tiger build.
<p>
Last binary release supporting PowerPC 64-bit: <b>R 2.9.2</b> (2009/09/16): <a href=R-2.9.2.pkg>R-2.9.2.pkg</a> (ca. 40MB).<br>
For more recent releases, see <a href=http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/>CRAN</a> and nightly builds above.
-->

<a name=gui></a>
<h3>Mac OS X GUI</h3>

<!--include GUI.html-->

<p>To install, open the image and drag the <b>R</b> icon to your <tt>Applications</tt> folder. Alternatively the GUI can be run directly off that image without copying if you just want to test it. Build configurations with "64" suffix are 64-bit builds, all others are 32-bit. If you want to use both, rename one of them or place them in different directories.

<!--
<h3>Mac OS X 10.3 nightly builds</h3>
This build is not supported anymore, but as long as the machine is still available the nightly builds for Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther) can be found at <a href=/panther/>http://R.research.att.com/panther/</a>.
-->

<a name=tools></a>
<h2>Tools</h2>

In order to compile R and R packages you will need <b>Xcode Developer Tools</b> version <b>3.1 or higher</b> and a universal Fortran compiler. For details and download, please read the <a href=/tools/>Tools page</a>.

<!--
<b>Developers interested in R 2.5.0 and higher, please read <a href=/tools/>this tools page</a> instead! The information below applies only to R 2.4.0 and earlier!</b>
<p>
If you want to use supplied binary packages only, you don't need to read any of the following, becuase R framework + GUI is all you need. However, if you want to compile your own R or compile packages from sources, read on.
<p>
If you installed universal R 2.3.0 from CRAN (the big 100MB image) then you're all set and everything is already installed.
<p>
In order to build packages for the above R, you will have to use the same compilers that R was built with. Unfortunately Xcode comes with an older version of gcc that has some critical bugs and doesn't include gfortran, so we have to use a more recent compiler. We use <tt>gcc 4.0.3</tt> FSF release with Darwin drivers, i.e. some flags like <tt>-arch</tt> are supported, but Apple-only extensions are not. The compiler lives in <tt>/usr/local/gcc4.0</tt> and can uninstalled by removing that directory (<tt>sudo rm -rf /usr/local/gcc4.0</tt>).

<p>
<b>gcc-4.0.3 release (FSF)</b> with Darwin drivers and multi-arch target support (ppc, ppc64 and i386):<br>
Download: <a href=gcc403.dmg>gcc403.dmg</a>
<p>
Note: if you have a previous version of gcc (e.g. you installed R 2.2.1 universal binary), remove it using <tt>sudo rm -rf /usr/local/gcc4.0</tt> before you install the new version.
<br>
The ppc64 target has not been tested, so your mileage may vary.
<p>
In addition to the compilers, <b>Intel Mac</b> users may need the ptATLAS libraries. If you installed universal R (2.2.1 or 2.3.0), you can skip this step, because you probably have them already.<br>
Download: <a href=atlas-lib-i686.tar.gz>atlas-lib-i686.tar.gz</a>
<p>
Install by typing
<div id=RC class=RC>
<tt>sudo tar fvxz ~/atlas-lib-i686.tar.gz -C /</tt>
</div>
The ATLAS libraries are optional if you build your own R: you can use vecLib (slowest), internal BLAS (fast on Core Solo) or the above ATLAS (best for Core Duo).
-->

<h3>Building universal binaries</h3>
<p>
Starting with R 2.5.0 CRAN binaries use Apple's 10.4u SDK allowing universal builds on both PowerPC and Intel Macs. <!-- Currently it is not possible to build universal binaries on PowerPC-based Macs, because the system doesn't include i386 libraries. You will need Intel-based Mac to build universal binaries. --> Building universal R is done by compliling two R binaries and setting <tt>r_arch</tt> parameter to <tt>ppc</tt> and <tt>i386</tt> respectively, along with the proper compiler flags. Those two builds can then be installed into the same framework location, R install process merges them correspondingly.
<p>
To build an universal package that contains a <tt>configure</tt> script, it is necessary to run <tt>R CMD</tt> twice. Assuming you have a source package <tt>foo_0.1.tar.gz</tt>, this is how you install it universally:
<div id=RC class=RC>
<tt>R CMD INSTALL foo_0.1.tar.gz</tt><br>
<tt>R --arch=ppc CMD INSTALL --libs-only foo_0.1.tar.gz</tt><br>
<tt>R --arch=x86_64 CMD INSTALL --libs-only foo_0.1.tar.gz</tt>
</div>
(Note: if the package doesn't contain a <tt>configure</tt> script, regular single-step installation actually works). You can create a binary package by packing such installed package into a tar ball. The resulting binary will work on both PowerPC and Intel-based Macs.

<h2>Experimental binary packages</h2>

This site is also a repository for experimental binaries, i.e. you could set it as your default repository for development verion of R such as <tt>options(repos=c(CRAN="http://r.research.att.com/"))</tt>
<br>The frequency of package updates is currently random - remember, this is an experimental repository and it may not be complete.
-->
<!--
<a name=bioc></a>
<h2>Experimental Bioconductor packages</h2>

We also build binaries for Bioconductor (<a href=http://www.bioconductor.org/>www.bioconductor.org</a>) packages nightly. In order to install BioC for R 2.4 from this repository, use
<pre>
source("http://R.research.att.com/scripts/2.4/biocinstall.R")
biocinstall()
</pre>
You can also use <tt>groupName="graph"</tt> or similar to install additional groups. Use <tt>http://R.research.att.com/packages/1.9/bioc</tt> (and its variations) as the repository if you want to install packages manually.
<p>
The current binaries are built for R 2.4.x (BioC 1.9). Binaries for R-devel should be available shortly (we are running out of disk space on the server - BioC  needs several GB per repository). -->
<!-- no longer needed - 64-bit is not the defualt in the Leopard build
<a name=R64></a>
<h2>Experimental 64-bit R</h2>

Experimental R builds have been moved to <a href=/exp/>this page</a>.
-->
<!--
<h3>PowerPC (G5) 64-bit R [ppc64]</h3>
The 64-bit experimental binary for G5-based Macs is available from the  <a href=exp>experimental builds</a> page. It is based on R 2.3.1 (patched) and the same gcc 4.0.3 compiler that commes with the CRAN binary of R. Visit the above pages for download and details on building 64-bit R.

<h3>Intel (Mac Pro) 64-bit R [x86_64]</h3>
R builds fine as 64-bit application on Intel Macs with Apple compilers and gfortran. See <a href=exp>experimental builds</a> page for details.
-->
<a name=old></a>
<h2>Legacy R</h2>
The current build supports only Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) or higher. Older versions of OS X are not supported in binary form, but R can be compiled from sources for such legacy OS versions. Last released version for Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) was <b>R 2.10.1</b>.
<!--
The following binaries are <b>unofficial and unsupported</b> and provided only as a by-product of the old R building process for people that cannot upgrade to Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) for some reason. <b>CRAN binary packages will NOT work</b> with this version!! Please do <b>not fill bug reports</b> on this version - you're entirely on your own.
<p>
Download: <a href=R-2.3.0-OSX-10.3.dmg>R-2.3.0-OSX-10.3.dmg</a> (ca. 34MB)
<p>
Experimental binaries for this build may be available at the <tt>http://r.research.att.com/panther/</tt> repository, i.e. you should specify that URL as your primary CRAN repository. Again, binary packages from the 'real' CRAN will NOT work!
<p>
Nightly builds for Panther can be found at <a href=/panther/>http://R.research.att.com/panther/</a> - again, please no bug reports about this one.
-->

<a name=other></a>
<h2>Other binaries</h2>

<!-- Binaries for R 2.3.0-2.4.1 are incompatible with all other R version (including the current R 2.5.0 version), therefore they have been removed for now. You can download some more recent binaries from the <a href="/tools/">Tools page</a>. 3rd party binaries for R 2.5.0 and higher will be posted here soon after the release. <p>-->
The following binaries are not maintained or supported by R-core and are provided without any guarantee and for convenience only (Mac OS X 10.4.4 or higher required). They match the binaries used on the CRAN binary build machine and thus are recommended for use with CRAN R package binaries.
