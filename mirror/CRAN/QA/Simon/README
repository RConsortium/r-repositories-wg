This is a partial copy of the nightly build system for R and packages
on Mac OS X. The packages system builds both CRAN and Bioconductor
(but the BioC build requires manual intervention when the release
number changes).

The layout on the build machine is as follows:
/Builds/packages         -> Simon/packages
/Builds/R-builds/nightly -> Simon/R-build

The root is defined by BASE or RBUILDS environment variables (most
scripts are migrated to BASE now, but not all of them, yet).

I hope to migrate the whole system into SVN soon, the current state is
untested as some files local to the machine are not included.

"local" directory holds auxiliary files specific to some build
machines (such as crontabs etc.).
