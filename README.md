# RC Working Group on Repositories

The package ecosystem is one of R’s great strengths: unlike many other languages you can be assured that any two packages installed from a repository (like CRAN or BioConductor) at the same time will work together.
But the R ecosystem has radically expanded since the package system was created, and that expansion has bought with it new constraints and new requirements.

The goal of this working group is to collaboratively explore how to support, maintain, and improve the tooling for package distribution, particularly with an eye to meeting new needs (e.g. the demands of regulated submission as experienced by the pharma community) and making sure R is well poised to thrive for the next 20 years.
